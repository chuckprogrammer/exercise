The Not-A-Scam NFT AI Streaming Industry Disruptor Service (NASNASIDS) is an app/tool/portal/product/software as a service designed to maximize returns on investment by luring lazy venture capitalists with as many buzzwords as possible, fleecing them, and then running off with the money before the legal system can catch up. NASNASIDS is an idea in the minds of a few business school drop-outs with nothing in the way of actual product knowledge or execution.

NASNASIDS does not claim, has not claimed, nor can ever claim to provide any discernable value as related to the marketplace, investors, employees (if applicable), society, or humanity in general. NASNASIDS is not a registered trademark since that would provide a period of time that could be used to see through the blatant grift.
