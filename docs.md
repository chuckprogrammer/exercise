The Not-A-Scam NFT AI Streaming Industry Disruptor Service (NASNASIDS) is an app/tool/portal/product/software as a service designed to maximize returns on investment by luring lazy venture capitalists with as many buzzwords as possible, fleecing them, and then running off with the money before the legal system can catch up. NASNASIDS is an idea in the minds of a few business school drop-outs with nothing in the way of actual product knowledge or execution. Despite copious red flags, investors will still jump at the chance to prop up NASNASIDS due to the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the degenerate state of late-stage capitalism. Despite the obvious con, investors don't care as long as someone else is holding the bag.

NASNASIDS does not claim, has not claimed, nor can ever claim to provide any discernable value as related to the marketplace, investors, employees (if applicable), society, or humanity in general. NASNASIDS is now a registered trademark. In the event that NASNASIDS ends up becoming a supplement, none of the claims about NASNASIDS have been approved by the FDA. NASNASIDS contains materials known to cause cancer in the state of California. NASNASIDS is not endorsed by Lil' Nas, nor has it been endorsed by a hypothetical Big Nas.
